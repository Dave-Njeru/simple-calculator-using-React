Practice on states and hooks in React

This project was a key component of the Meta Front-end Developer certification, specifically within the React Basics module. The primary objective was to create a simple calculator application that could perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Through this practical exercise, participants were able to solidify their understanding of crucial React concepts, with a particular emphasis on states, refs, and hooks.

The calculator project served as an ideal platform for demonstrating the practical application of React's core features. By implementing the calculator's functionality, developers had to manage the application's state, possibly using the useState hook to keep track of the current input and results. The use of refs might have been explored for directly accessing and manipulating DOM elements, while other hooks like useEffect could have been employed to handle side effects in the component lifecycle. This hands-on approach not only reinforced theoretical knowledge but also provided valuable experience in building interactive user interfaces with React, preparing me for more complex front-end development challenges.
